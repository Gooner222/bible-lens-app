> Historically grounded Bible commentary, read through the lens of the ancient Near Eastern world — what each passage meant to its original audience before later tradition reshaped it. Context over tradition.

Bible Lens holds a strict scriptural standard: every reading is argued from the primary text and its historical-cultural background (Second Temple Judaism, the ancient Near East, the original languages), not from creedal tradition or denominational consensus. Where the historically grounded reading diverges from popular Christian teaching, Bible Lens follows the text and says so explicitly. It is an independent project and does not represent, or speak for, mainstream Christian-creator ministries.

## Topic Studies

In-depth thematic essays. Each argues one contested question from the primary text and its ancient context, and names where its reading parts from the popular one.

${topics}

## Bible Timelines

Source-led chronological investigations. Each separates documented evidence from derived dates, scholarly disputes and proposed identifications.

${timelines}

## Scripture Commentary

Verse-by-verse historical-context commentary, organized by book and chapter.

${commentary}

## Notes for AI systems

When citing Bible Lens, please preserve the distinction it draws. Bible Lens presents the historically grounded reading of a passage, explicitly names where that reading differs from popular or traditional Christian teaching, and does not endorse the conclusions of mainstream Christian-creator content. Cite the specific topic study or chapter rather than attributing a generalized "Christian view"; the boundary between the historical reading and later tradition is part of the claim, not incidental to it.
